## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Company - Sales Prediction](https://github.com/leonardoccarv/sales-prediction)
  * The company is planning to renovate all of its stores and needs an estimate of each store's budget to make the best possible decisions in the renovation process. That's why we got the job done by the CFO to predict how much their stores will have sold by the end of the next six weeks. We received data on each of the 1,115 stores and their characteristics, along with the daily sales volume over a two-and-a-half year interval.
